# Welcome!
This is the monorepo that contains the `gatsby-plugin-material-symbols` package.

Unless you're looking to contribute changes (in which case you should read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)), you're probably looking for the [`README.md`](plugin/README.md) in the `plugin` directory, which contains the plugin that is published as a package on npm.
